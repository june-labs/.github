### Our Mission

The current AI paradigm is built on a flawed foundation. Stateless, token-based models have reached a critical ceiling in both cost and capability. They are powerful, but they do not learn. They recall, but they do not understand.

At June, we are building the solution. Our mission is to create a new class of stateful, concept-centric AI that learns continuously from experience. We are building the foundational substrate for the next generation of truly intelligent systems.

### Our Technology

Our core technology, the June Platform, is a stateful, cloud-native architecture inspired by the principles of neurobiology. It is currently under active development.

### Get Involved

* **Follow our journey:** We are just getting started. Follow our founder on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/june-labs-ai/) and [Twitter/X](https://x.com/codecapo_) for updates.
* **Careers:** We are not actively hiring yet, but we will be soon. We are looking for the best and brightest minds in AI and distributed systems.
